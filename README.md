# MNIST Sample with Tensor<T> and CNTK
  
[Tensor<T>](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/15/introducing-tensor-for-machine-learning-and-ai-libraries) is an exchange type for homogenous multi-dimensional data for 1 to N dimensions. The motivation behind introducing Tensor<T> is to make it easy for Machine Learning library vendors like CNTK, Tensorflow, Caffe, Scikit-Learn to port their libraries over to .NET with minimal dependencies in place.  Tensor<T> is designed to provide the following characteristics.
  
This sample is a very simple WPF application which recognizes hand-written digits using the pre-built MNIST convolutional model. The sample provides you an example of how you can use Tensor<T> today with CNTK for using a pre-built CNTK MNIST model. To use this sample just clone this repo and launch it in Visual Studio 2017.
